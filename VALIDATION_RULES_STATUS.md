# Validation Rules Field - Current Status

## Status: INACTIVE (Future Feature)

The "Validation Rules" field in the Airtable "Form Fields" table is **NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED** and should not be used.

## Why This Field Exists

This field was added to the Airtable schema for future Phase 3 development planning. It allows the team to prepare the data structure without requiring code changes later.

## Current Implementation Status

### What's NOT Working:
- ❌ Field is not fetched from Airtable API
- ❌ No TypeScript interface includes validation rules
- ❌ No code processes or applies validation rules
- ❌ No validation logic executes on form fields
- ❌ Setting values in this field has ZERO effect on the application

### What IS Working:
- ✅ HTML5 native validation (required fields, number types, etc.)
- ✅ Field type validation (text, number, dropdown, etc.)
- ✅ Required field checks
- ✅ Conditional field visibility

## For Airtable Users

**DO NOT** configure the "Validation Rules" field at this time. Any values entered will be ignored by the application.

### Recommended Action in Airtable:

**Option A: Rename the field** to make it clear:
```
Validation Rules (INACTIVE - Phase 3)
```

**Option B: Hide the field** from your Airtable views to reduce confusion

**Option C: Add a field description** in Airtable:
```
⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED - This is a placeholder for Phase 3 development.
Do not configure. Values are not read by the application.
```

## When Will This Be Implemented?

Phase 3 implementation will add:
- Custom validation patterns (regex)
- Custom validation messages
- Min/max value validation
- Custom validation logic
- Integration with form field rendering

## What Validation Works Today?

Current form validation includes:
1. **Required Fields** - Set via "Required" checkbox
2. **Field Types** - Enforced by "Field Type" (number, text, etc.)
3. **Dropdown Options** - Defined via "Field Options" JSON
4. **Conditional Logic** - Fields show/hide based on "Conditional Logic" JSON

## Technical Details

### Code References:
- `src/types/quote.ts:190` - FormField interface (no validationRules property)
- `src/utils/formFieldsService.ts:136-154` - Airtable fetch (doesn't request Validation Rules column)
- `src/components/DynamicFormField.tsx` - Form rendering (no validation rule processing)

### Database Schema:
The field exists in Airtable but is not mapped to the application's data layer.

## Summary

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Field in Airtable | ✅ Exists |
| Field in TypeScript | ❌ Not defined |
| Fetched from API | ❌ Not requested |
| Processed by code | ❌ Not implemented |
| User Impact | ⚠️ Creates confusion |
| **Recommendation** | **Mark as INACTIVE or hide from views** |

# Conditional Field Width Fix

## Problem

Conditional fields that appeared based on user selections were rendering full-width even when Airtable's **Field Width** column was set to "half". This caused layout inconsistencies where conditional fields didn't respect their configured width settings.

### Example Issue

**Airtable Configuration:**
```
Field Name: additionalStateCount
Field Label: Number of Additional States
Field Width: half
Conditional Logic: Shows when "hasMultipleStates" is checked
```

**Before Fix:**
- Field appears full-width (100%) when condition is met
- Ignores Field Width = "half" setting
- Cannot pair with other half-width fields

**After Fix:**
- Field appears at half-width (50%) when condition is met
- Respects Field Width setting
- Can pair with another half-width field

## Root Cause

The Row Group logic was treating all fields **without** an explicit Row Group value as full-width single fields. This meant:

1. Fields with `rowGroup = undefined` → Always full-width
2. Fields with `fieldWidth = 'half'` but no `rowGroup` → Ignored

The conditional logic filtering happened correctly (fields showed/hid), but the width styling wasn't applied to fields without Row Groups.

## Solution

Updated the field grouping logic to handle three scenarios:

### 1. Fields with Row Group (Explicit Grouping)
```typescript
if (field.rowGroup !== undefined && field.rowGroup !== null) {
  // Group all fields with same Row Group number
  // Works as before - no change needed
}
```

### 2. Fields with Field Width = "half" (Implicit Pairing)
```typescript
else if (field.fieldWidth === 'half') {
  // NEW: Look for consecutive half-width fields to pair
  const nextField = sortedFields[nextIndex];

  if (nextField?.fieldWidth === 'half' && displayOrdersClose) {
    // Pair these two half-width fields into a group
    groupedFields.push({ type: 'group', fields: [field, nextField] });
  } else {
    // Single half-width field (still renders at half width)
    groupedFields.push({ type: 'single', field: field });
  }
}
```

### 3. Fields without Row Group or Field Width (Default Full-Width)
```typescript
else {
  // Full-width single field
  groupedFields.push({ type: 'single', field: field });
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

**Updated:**
- `/src/components/DynamicServiceDetailStep.tsx` - Added half-width field pairing logic
- `/src/components/IndividualTaxDynamic.tsx` - Added half-width field pairing logic

### Key Changes

#### 1. Field Pairing Logic

```typescript
else if (field.fieldWidth === 'half') {
  // Handle half-width fields without explicit Row Group
  const nextFieldIndex = sortedFields.findIndex(f =>
    f.fieldId === field.fieldId
  ) + 1;

  const nextField = nextFieldIndex < sortedFields.length ?
    sortedFields[nextFieldIndex] : null;

  if (nextField &&
      nextField.fieldWidth === 'half' &&
      !processedFields.has(nextField.fieldId) &&
      Math.abs(nextField.displayOrder - field.displayOrder) <= 1) {
    // Pair these two half-width fields
    processedFields.add(field.fieldId);
    processedFields.add(nextField.fieldId);

    groupedFields.push({
      type: 'group',
      fields: [field, nextField],
      sectionHeader: field.sectionHeader,
      sectionIcon: field.sectionIcon
    });
  } else {
    // Single half-width field (will still render at half width)
    processedFields.add(field.fieldId);
    groupedFields.push({
      type: 'single',
      field: field
    });
  }
}
```

**Pairing Criteria:**
- ✅ Both fields have `fieldWidth = 'half'`
- ✅ Fields are consecutive in sorted order
- ✅ Display Order difference ≤ 1
- ✅ Next field hasn't been processed yet

#### 2. Width Class Application

```typescript
else if (item.type === 'single' && item.field) {
  const field = item.field;

  // Determine width class based on Field Width column
  const widthClass = field.fieldWidth === 'half' ?
    'w-full md:w-1/2' :
    'w-full';

  elements.push(
    <div className={`${widthClass} mb-6 transition-all`}>
      <DynamicFormField ... />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Width Classes:**
- `fieldWidth = 'half'` → `w-full md:w-1/2` (50% on desktop, 100% on mobile)
- Otherwise → `w-full` (100% on all screens)

## Behavior Examples

### Example 1: Single Half-Width Conditional Field

**Airtable:**
```
Field: additionalStateCount
Field Width: half
Conditional Logic: Shows when hasMultipleStates = true
```

**Rendering:**
```
Before condition met:
(field hidden)

After condition met:
[Additional States: 0        ]  ← Half-width (50%)
```

### Example 2: Paired Half-Width Conditional Fields

**Airtable:**
```
Field A: selfEmploymentBusinessCount
Field Width: half
Display Order: 10
Conditional Logic: Shows when incomeTypes includes "Self-Employment"

Field B: k1Count
Field Width: half
Display Order: 11
Conditional Logic: Shows when incomeTypes includes "S-Corp/Partnership"
```

**Rendering:**

**Both conditions true:**
```
[Self-Emp Businesses: 0]  [K-1s Received: 0]
```
Two fields side-by-side (auto-paired)

**Only first condition true:**
```
[Self-Emp Businesses: 0        ]  ← Half-width (50%)
```
Single field at half-width

**Only second condition true:**
```
[K-1s Received: 0              ]  ← Half-width (50%)
```
Single field at half-width

**Neither condition true:**
```
(both fields hidden)
```

### Example 3: Mixed Full and Half-Width Fields

**Airtable:**
```
Field A: filingStatus
Field Width: (empty/full)
Display Order: 1

Field B: annualIncome
Field Width: (empty/full)
Display Order: 2

Field C: hasMultipleStates (checkbox)
Field Width: (empty/full)
Display Order: 3

Field D: additionalStateCount (conditional)
Field Width: half
Display Order: 4
Conditional: Shows when hasMultipleStates = true
```

**Rendering:**

**Before checking hasMultipleStates:**
```
[Filing Status                          ▼]
[Annual Income                          ▼]
☐ I file in multiple states
```

**After checking hasMultipleStates:**
```
[Filing Status                          ▼]
[Annual Income                          ▼]
☑ I file in multiple states
[Additional States: 0        ]  ← Half-width appears
```

## Responsive Behavior

### Mobile (< 768px)
All fields stack vertically at full width:
```
[Field A               ]
[Field B               ]
[Field C               ]
```

### Desktop (≥ 768px)
Half-width fields display at 50%:
```
[Field A] [Field B]    ← Half-width fields
[Field C               ] ← Full-width field
```

**Tailwind Classes:**
- `w-full` → 100% on all screens
- `md:w-1/2` → 50% on medium+ screens
- Combined: `w-full md:w-1/2` → Mobile-first responsive

## Priority Logic

The grouping logic checks conditions in this order:

1. **Row Group** (highest priority)
   - Explicit grouping via Row Group number
   - Overrides Field Width setting

2. **Field Width = "half"** (medium priority)
   - Implicit pairing of consecutive half-width fields
   - Applied when Row Group not set

3. **Default** (lowest priority)
   - Full-width rendering
   - Used when no other settings present

### Example Priority Conflict

**Airtable:**
```
Field: myField
Row Group: 5
Field Width: half
```

**Result:** Field grouped with Row Group 5 fields (Row Group wins)

The Field Width is ignored when Row Group is set because Row Group provides explicit multi-column control.

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Odd Number of Half-Width Fields

**Scenario:**
```
Field A: fieldWidth = 'half', displayOrder = 10
Field B: fieldWidth = 'half', displayOrder = 11
Field C: fieldWidth = 'half', displayOrder = 12
```

**Result:**
```
[Field A] [Field B]    ← Paired
[Field C      ]        ← Single at half-width
```

### Case 2: Non-Consecutive Half-Width Fields

**Scenario:**
```
Field A: fieldWidth = 'half', displayOrder = 10
Field B: fieldWidth = 'full', displayOrder = 11
Field C: fieldWidth = 'half', displayOrder = 12
```

**Result:**
```
[Field A      ]        ← Single at half-width
[Field B               ] ← Full-width
[Field C      ]        ← Single at half-width
```

### Case 3: Half-Width Field with Condition

**Scenario:**
```
Field A: fieldWidth = 'half', displayOrder = 10, always visible
Field B: fieldWidth = 'half', displayOrder = 11, conditional (currently hidden)
```

**Result:**
```
[Field A      ]        ← Single at half-width (no pair available)
```

**After Field B appears:**
```
[Field A] [Field B]    ← Now paired
```

### Case 4: Display Order Gap

**Scenario:**
```
Field A: fieldWidth = 'half', displayOrder = 10
Field B: fieldWidth = 'half', displayOrder = 13  (gap > 1)
```

**Result:**
```
[Field A      ]        ← Single at half-width
[Field B      ]        ← Single at half-width
```

Fields NOT paired because display order difference is 3 (> 1)

### Case 5: All Fields Conditionally Hidden

**Scenario:**
```
Field A: conditional, currently hidden
Field B: conditional, currently hidden
```

**Result:**
```
(no fields rendered)
```

No layout issues - entire group simply not displayed

## Comparison with Row Group

### Row Group Method (Explicit)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Explicit control over grouping
- ✅ Works with 2, 3, 4+ fields
- ✅ Guaranteed pairing

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires manual Row Group number assignment
- ❌ More configuration in Airtable

**Example:**
```
Field A: rowGroup = 7
Field B: rowGroup = 7
```
Always paired, regardless of Field Width

### Field Width Method (Implicit)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple configuration (just set Field Width)
- ✅ Auto-pairing based on display order
- ✅ Flexible (works for single or paired fields)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Only supports 2 fields per row
- ❌ Pairing based on proximity (not guaranteed)

**Example:**
```
Field A: fieldWidth = 'half', displayOrder = 10
Field B: fieldWidth = 'half', displayOrder = 11
```
Auto-paired if consecutive

### When to Use Which?

**Use Row Group when:**
- You need 3+ fields on one row
- You want guaranteed pairing
- Fields aren't consecutive in display order
- You need precise control

**Use Field Width when:**
- You need simple 2-field pairing
- Fields are consecutive
- You want minimal configuration
- Conditional fields that may appear/disappear

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Half-width field without condition renders at 50%
- [ ] Full-width field without condition renders at 100%
- [ ] Field Width respected on desktop (≥768px)
- [ ] Fields stack on mobile (<768px)

### Conditional Logic
- [ ] Half-width conditional field renders at 50% when visible
- [ ] Half-width conditional field hidden when condition false
- [ ] Width class applied when field appears dynamically
- [ ] Smooth transition when field appears/disappears

### Pairing Behavior
- [ ] Two consecutive half-width fields pair automatically
- [ ] Non-consecutive half-width fields don't pair
- [ ] Odd number of half-width fields handled correctly
- [ ] Display order gap > 1 prevents pairing

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Half-width field alone renders at 50% (not 100%)
- [ ] Mixed full/half width fields render correctly
- [ ] Row Group overrides Field Width setting
- [ ] All fields hidden = no layout issues

### Responsive Design
- [ ] Desktop: Half-width = 50%, Full-width = 100%
- [ ] Mobile: All fields = 100%
- [ ] Smooth transitions between breakpoints
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling

## Migration Notes

### No Breaking Changes

This fix is **backward compatible**:

✅ Existing Row Group fields work unchanged
✅ Existing full-width fields work unchanged
✅ No Airtable schema changes required
✅ No data migration needed

### Enhanced Behavior

**Before:**
